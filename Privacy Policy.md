# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the Nikshit Portfolio app (hereby referred to as "Application"), created by Nikshit Bhateja (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a free application for showcasing iOS & Flutter projects.


### Information Collection and Use
The Application is designed purely as a portfolio showcase and does not collect, store, or share any personal user data.
However, the Application may use Firebase as a backend service, which may process non-personally identifiable data, such as:
* General app usage analytics (e.g., number of visits, time spent on different sections).
* Crash reports and performance insights to improve user experience.

### Third-Party Services
The Application uses Firebase for analytics and backend services. Firebase may collect aggregated, anonymised data to enhance performance and usability. Firebaseâ€™s privacy practices can be reviewed here.
The Service Provider does not share or sell any user data to third parties.

### Opt-Out Rights
Since the Application does not collect personal data, no opt-out is required. However, if you do not wish to use the Application, you can simply uninstall it from your device.

### Data Retention Policy
As the Application does not collect or store personal data, no user data is retained. Any analytics data collected via Firebase is handled according to Firebaseâ€™s retention policies.

### Children's Privacy
This Application is intended for general audiences and does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided any personal information, please contact the Service Provider at iosdevelopernikshit@gmail.com, and appropriate action will be taken.

### Security
The Service Provider is committed to safeguarding user experience by implementing industry-standard security measures within the Firebase backend. However, since no personal data is collected, there is no risk of personal information being exposed.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically. Any changes will be reflected by updating this page. You are encouraged to review this Privacy Policy regularly.
Effective Date: March 23, 2025
